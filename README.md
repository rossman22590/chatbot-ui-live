## üöß Getting Started with unSAGED

### Step 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jorge-menjivar/unSAGED.git
```

### Step 2. Generate Supabase Tables

Run the [Generation Script](./GenerationScript.sql) in the [Supabase SQL editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql).

This will do the following:

- Create the tables required by unSAGED.
- Create the authentication schema and tables required by NextAuth.js.
- Enable Row Level Security for the tables required by unSAGED.
- Apply the Row Level Security policies required by unSAGED.

### Step 3. Expose the next_auth schema

Expose the next_auth schema in the [API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/*/settings/api) by adding next_auth to the "Exposed schemas" list.

More information [here](https://authjs.dev/reference/adapter/supabase#expose-the-nextauth-schema-in-supabase).

### Step 4. Create your auth secret

Create your secret with the following command:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32
```

copy the output and save it for the next step.

### Step 5. Create a .env.local file

Create a `.env.local` file and set the following variable:

```sh
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_from_step_4
```

### Step 6. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

### Step 7. Run App

Run Locally:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or run with Docker:

```sh
docker build -t unsaged . --rm
docker run --env-file=.env.local -p 3000:3000 --name unsaged unsaged
```

### (Optional) Step 8. Provide API Keys in .env.local

To give everyone using your instance of unSAGED access to any API key, create a `.env.local` file and set the appropriate environment variables.
If you do not provide an API key in the env file, users will have to provide their own key.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

When deploying the application, the following environment variables can be set:

### Env Variables

- COGNITO
- DISCORD
- FACEBOOK
- GITHUB
- GITLAB
- GOOGLE
- OKTA
- REDDIT
- SALESFORCE
- SLACK
- SPOTIFY
- TWITCH
- TWITTER

For example, to enable Google and Github authentication, you would add the following to your `.env.local` file:

```sh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

For Auth0, you would add the following:

```sh
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
AUTH0_ISSUER=https://mydomain.us.auth0.com
```
